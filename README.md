### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
First and foremost I love writing code and solving problems.
Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.

I am a passionate javascript, typescript, rust and go developer with expertise in React and NextJS.
